  about_page: 
    intro: You are participating in an “photo marketplace” that enables groups to collect and prioritize photos in a democratic, open, and efficient process. By combining a simple voting process with open uploading of photos, the best photos in your group will bubble to the top. 
    how_many_votes_q: How many votes can I cast? When does it end?
    how_many_votes_exp: You can vote as little or as much as you want, and you can stop voting at any time.
    how_many_ideas_q: How many photos can I add? What happens to my photo once I add it?
    how_many_ideas_exp: You can add as many photos as you have. Once an photo is added, it may be reviewed by the person who created the photo marketplace in order to ensure that it is not inappropriate. Once the photo has been reviewed, it will start appearing for people to vote on it.
    view_results_q: Can I see what everyone else thinks? 
    view_results_exp: Yes, simply click on “View Results” from the voting screen. This process is completely transparent.
    make_my_own_q: This is neat. Can I make one of these myself?
    make_my_own_exp: "Sure. It is easy to set up your own photo marketplace, and it is completely free thanks to our grants from Google and the Center for Information Technology Policy at Princeton University. You can create your own photo marketplace here: http://www.photocracy.org/questions/new."

  tour:
    collect: Collect and sort suggestions effectively
    p1: Just as Wikipedia is a platform that allows groups to collaboratively write an encyclopedia, Photocracy is a platform that allows groups to collect and prioritize photos in a transparent, democratic, and bottom-up process.
    p2: To see how Photocracy works, we’ll walk through a specific example. Imagine that you are the president of the Undergraduate Student Government at Princeton and you need to find the issues of greatest concern to the student body. Everyone is telling you what they want, but nobody fills out surveys so you don’t know how widespread the support for any of these photos really is. Plus, how do you even know if your student priority survey includes all the important photos?
    p3: This is a natural problem for Photocracy system of voting and soliciting suggestions. Once the platform for collaboration was created, more than 2,000 students contributed more than 40,000 votes and uploaded more than 100 new suggestions.
    p4: "You can create such a platform for collaboration for your group in a few easy steps. In the end we are going to help you create something that looks like this:"
    step1: "Step 1: Create a website"
    step1_txt: 'Pick a question that voters see. For example, "Which do you want more?"'
    step2: "Step 2: Pick a URL"
    step2_txt: 'Pick a "quick url" that will take visitors to your site. For example, if the undergraduate student government wanted people to go to www.photocracy.org/usg they would have picked the quick url "usg".'
    step3: "Step 3: Upload Photos"
    step3_txt: Upload some photos. For example, the student government started about 200 with photos such as lower textbook prices, extend library hours, and outdoor hammocks. The more photos the better because the voting process will help you find the best ones.
    step4: "Step 4: Spread your URL"
    step4_txt: "Spread your url and watch what happens. You can get an photo of what the final product looks like by trying it below:"
