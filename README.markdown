All Our Ideas
-------------------

All Our Ideas 2.0.  This codebase runs two sites [photocracy.org](http://www.photocracy.org/) and [allourideas.org](http://www.allourideas.org/).

The allourideas.org project provides the user-facing website for doing pairwise voting. This project depends on the API provided by [pairwise-api](https://github.com/allourideas/pairwise-api).  There are several models that are [ActiveResource](http://apidock.com/rails/v2.3.8/ActiveResource/Base) models that connect to the [pairwise API](https://github.com/allourideas/pairwise-api).
